# privateinternetaccess.com Mac OS X VPN config generator
Many VPN Services come with an own client who knows how to connect to the different server locations. So does PrivateInternetAccess's VPN service, too.

Of course, you can choose to add 18+ various server locations on your own, but, trust me, this is painful. So I created this little script to generate a VPN configuration file containing all server locaions. 
It's easy as 1-2-3 and ready to import!
